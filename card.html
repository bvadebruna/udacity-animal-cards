				<p class="d">A cow has 32 teeth. A cow will chew about 50 times in a minute, making their jaws move about 40,000 times a day. The main stomach of a cow, the rumen, holds up to 50 gallons of food that has been partially digested. Referred to as cud, a cow will chew for up to eight hours a day</p>
